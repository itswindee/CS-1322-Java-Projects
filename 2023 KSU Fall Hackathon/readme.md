# 2023-Fall-Hackathon

For the KSU Fall Hackathon of 2023, our sponsor is Genuine Parts Company.

Given todayâ€™s rising transportation challenges with pandemics, inflation, fuel costs, labor shortage, customer expectations and environmental impact awareness, the need to fully utilize
shipment capacity is becoming a strategic necessity.

Modern supply chains must maximize whatever shipping mode is available to meet the demands of their customer while minimizing transportation costs, but much of the industry does not utilize efficient planning tools which leaves their shipments only partially full. This is a problem called "paying to ship air".

Our mission is to develop a model that will optimize usage of the available space of a container given the cubic space and the items needing to be
shipped.

Examples of a Container Space to Optimize:
Box Truck: 24ft length, 8ft high, and 8ft wide. Max weight 26,000 pounds.

Shipping Container: 40ft length, 8'6' high, and 8ft wide. Max weight 59,200 pounds.

Storage Unit: 20ft length, 8ft high, and 10ft wide.

Pallets (fits inside containers): 48" length, 5ft high, and 40" wide. Max weight 4,600 pounds.
